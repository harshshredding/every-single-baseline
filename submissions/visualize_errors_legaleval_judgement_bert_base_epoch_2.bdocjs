Cooper v. Union of India, (1970) 1 SCC 248 and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, (1978) 1 SCC 248, the consequence is the same.\n(See Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn., 2004 at p. \n\n 438.).\nTheir Lordships have said --  \"It is a sound rule of construction of a statute firmly established in England as far back as 1584 when Heydon's case was decided that --\"......\nIn para 13 of the plaint, it has been further averred that, \"When the plaintiffs asked the defendant to obtain requisite documents immediately, the defendant assured the plaintiffs that he would obtain the requisite documents and would be available on 29/12/2004 at the office of the Sub\u00adRegistrar, Geeta Colony, Delhi and would execute the sale deed\".\nCounsel for appellants contended that who is the Jagirdar against whom the legal fiction is to apply, is not pleaded by the claim petitioners and the scope and ambit of Rule 2 of the Rules regarding 'Grant of Pattadari rights in non-Khalsa villages', 1356 Fasli framed under Section 172 of the Hyderabad Land Revenue Act, 1317 Fasli is nebulous.\nFurther, section 19(3) of the SG Act specifies that unless a different intention appears, rules contained in section 20 to 24 rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property and goods is to passed to the buyer.\nHence, the Trial Court convicted the Appellant under Section 13(2) read with Section 13(1)(e) of the PC Act; as well as Sections 120B and 193 of the IPC, and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for two years and payment of fine of Rs 1.5 lakhs.\nThe LoA stipulated that:\n\n \"17.

No. 464 of 2018 merits outright dismissal.\nThe defendant no. 9 also filed an application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, wherein it was averred that the plaintiff neither filed the suit in accordance with the provisions of Rajasthan Court Fee and Suit valuation (Amendment) Act, 2009 nor in accordance with the provisions of Section 304 of the Municipality Act.\n                      another writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India                       was again filed being W.P.(C) No.616 of 2020, which was dismissed                       as withdrawn on 21.07.2020, the order is extracted herein under:\n\n                              \u201cAfter    arguing    for   sometime,    Mr.     Sanjay   Hegde,\n                              learned senior counsel\nWhen a statute is impugned under Article 14 what the court has to decide is whether the statute is so arbitrary or unreasonable that it must be struck down.\nThe learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred in not following the ratio laid down by ITAT.\n\n\n 3.

State of Maharashtra [1961 AIR 600] and Maru Ram2 held that power under Articles - 72 and 161 of the Constitution of India is absolute and cannot be lettered by any statutory provision, such .\nShri Parasaran further submits that the fundamental right of the Muslim community under Article 25, to offer namaz, is not affected because the Babri Masjid was not a mosque with particular significance for that religion.\nCorrespondingly, by delegated legislation incorporated by the Central Government, it may extend that time limit.\nThe complainant, along with other neighbours, went to search deceased Dharam Chand on 8 th February, 1999 and at village Bhagwanpura, outside the godown of brother deceased Dharam Chand, found his motorcycle but his whereabouts were not made known.\nAnd which power to designate inter-State supply also comes from Articles 246A, 269A(1) read with 269A(5) as discussed earlier.\nFurther, the Assessing Officer is directed to deposit the amount of Rs.7,59,185/- in HDFC Bank, Fort, Mumbai and Rs.34,265/- in State Bank of India, Byculla, Mumbai within a period of one week from today.\n\n\n2. T. Vasanthakumar -vs- Vijayakumari, reported in AIR 2015 Supreme Court 2240 wherein it has held that Negotiable Instruments Act (26 of 1881), Ss.138 and 139 -  C.C.NO.7919/2017 Dishonour of Cheque - Appeal against acquittal - Cheque as well as signature on it not disputed by accused respondent -\nThe petition was filed through Sh. Vijay Pahwa, General Power of Attorney and it was asserted in the petition under Section 13-B of the Rent Act that 1 of 23 50% share of the demised premises had been purchased by the landlord from Sh. Vinod Malhotra vide sale deed No.4226 registered on 20.12.2007 with Sub Registrar, Chandigarh.\nIt is seen from the record that the arbitration proceedings were held by Arbitrator Ms. Rashmi Jain, Advocate at her office at Shop No.12, Club Road Market, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi-110026.\nSuch signed statements are covered by the definition of ''document'' given in section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act.\nHe had not seen any other shop of Imambaksh and Jameel.\nWe note that the Finance Bill, 2021 has brought in an amendment which disallows the employees' contribution made in PF and ESI if not made within the due date as prescribed by the respective statutes (PF and ESI Act).\nPW1, in his evidence, has categorically stated that the deceased Mukhtar Ahmed was elected as the Chairman of the Municipality, Jaspur in the election prior to the election at the time of occurrence and that his wife Smt. Sameena Begum had contested the next election for the post of the Chairman against Smt. Farida Begum and Sameena Begum had lost that election.\nThere is another important factor which is taken for consideration is that the alleged sample was taken on 26.07.1992 and it was sent to the Chemical Examiner on 12.08.1992.\nSri Sunil B.Ganu, learned counsel, would however press into service Section 14(3)(c) and assert that the plaintiffs suit is barred thereunder.\nIn support of his contention, he relied upon the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 'Authorized Officer, State Bank of Travancore vs. Mathew K.C.2'. \n\n \nThe management witness Shri Gopinath Dasgupta - DRM North Bengal Regional Office, Ramprakash Sarkar - sub- staff Mahabirsthan Branch as well as Ms. Omit Namchu management witness stated in their examination in chief that the appellant made a confessional statement in writing accepting the fraudulent withdrawal of Rs.23,000/-only from the bank account of Shri Mrinal Kanti Ghosh.\nThe origins of the law can also 80 of 164 be traced to the principles of natural justice, as developed in the following cases: in A. K. Kraipak v. Union of India, (1969) 2 SCC 262, it was held that the rules of natural justice operate in areas not covered by any law.\nApplying the law aforesaid, the acquisition of land stood completed on publication of Section 3G declaration and the same remains unaffected.\nHe also deposed that he examined PW-1 and after her examination additional offences under Sections 5, 6 and 7 of PITA, Act i.e. ITP Act and Sections 294, 376 & 34 RPC were added on different dates.\nBut, if the information given clearly mentions the commission of a cognizable offence, there is no other option but (2014) 2 SCC 1 to register an FIR forthwith.\nThereafter, he was told about his legal rights under Section 50 of the NDPS Act 1985 and a notice under Section 50 of the NDPS Act 1985 was served to him.\nThis is because prima facie every legislation is prospective (see para 7 of the Constitution Bench judgment in Janardan Reddy v. The State reported in AIR 1951 SC 124).\nIn this connection, reference may be had to the Full Bench decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in V. Narayana Rao v. State of A.P. [AIR 1987 AP 53 : 1987 Lab IC 152 : (1986) 2 Andh LT 258] , striking down the enhancement of reservation from 25% to 44% for OBCs.\nSuo Motu Writ Petition (C) No.1 of 2020, dated 07.05.2021 KL,J W.P. Nos.20421 of 2019 & batch Arnesh Kumar v. State of Bihar [(2014) 8 SCC 273] during pandemic......\" \n\n\"10.\nBefore re-appreciating the evidence, we would like to make it clear at the first instance itself that though charge sheet is filed against accused Nos.1 to 7 invoking offences under Sections 120B, 212, 302, 147, 148, 149, 506B of IPC and Section 27 of Indian Arms Act\nChapter XIII deals with offences, punishments for violation of various clauses of the Act and procedures thereon.\nTherefore, crime No. 136/2018 under Section 306/34 of IPC was registered on 22.05.2018.\nIt is not in dispute that there is no witness to the fact alleged by the NIA that appellants/accused persons used the bicycles to purchase and planted bombs causing explosion at Malegaon.\nChapter-X of the Indian Railways Code for the Engineering Department, issued by the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board), Government of India, relates to the custody, management and disposal of land.\n, in Laxmi Pat Surana v. Union Bank of India, Civil Appeal No. 2734 of 2020, a judgment delivered on 26.03.2021, this Court, after referring to various judgments of this Court, including the judgment in Babulal Vardharji Gurjar v. Veer Gurjar Aluminium Industries (P) Ltd., (2020) 15 SCC 1 [\u201cBabulal\u201d], then held:\n \u201c35\n\n\n C.C.No.2468/2018 That, the accused shall deposit the fine amount of Rs.90,000/- and in default of deposit of said fine amount, he shall undergo a simple imprisonment for one month.\nThe accused agreed to repay the said amount with interest at the rate of 18% per annum and towards the repayment of the said amount, the accused had issued a cheque dated 14.10.2008 in favor of the complainant for a sum of Rs.20 lakhs.\nOur attention was drawn to Parashuram Pottery Works Co. Ltd. V. ITO, Circle I, Ward A, Rajkot, (1977) 106 ITR 1 (SC) which records that the Assessing Officer entrusted with the task of calculating and realizing tax should familiarize themselves with the relevant provisions and become well versed with the law on the subject.\nTherefore, the statement of witness A.D.2 Bhag Chand Khateek cannot be considered distrust worthy that his name in the charge sheet is not mentioned as witness.\" \n(emphasis supplied)\n \n 28.\nAt this juncture, it would be apt to reproduce herein below Section 23 of the DV Act, which reads as under:-\n 23.

GARG & ANR. v. N.D. GROVER THROUGH LRS no. 1 can be referred to).\nThe observation in Md.Mohar Ali (supra) stating that an agreement of sale is an unilateral contract is not correct.\nAnother three Judges bench of the Apex Court in Bikram Singh vs. Land Acquisition Collector, (1997) 224 ITR 551 following Dr. Shamlal Narula's case (supra) and taking into consideration definition of \"interest\" in Section 2(28A) of the Act had recorded that interest under Section 28 of the 1894 Act was a revenue receipt and is taxable.\nSection 151 reads:\n \"Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court.\" \n\n21.\nThose lands had been acquired long back during the time of his predecessor, Sri Kothegala Shivabasappa Swamy and that he received the compensation as the head of Devanur Mutt.\nBy means of Government order dated 19/02/1990 & 22/03/1990 it was further clarified that Non-Practicing Allowance shall form part of basic salary as described in financial handbook vol II to IV in rule 9(21)(1).\nIt is trite that under the Evidence Act 1872 facts have to be proved by primary evidence and secondary evidence is only an exception to the rule.\nThe Delhi High Court in the case of Printpak Machinery v. Jay Kay Paper Congeners reported in AIR, 1979 Delhi 271 has also held that the non- obstinate clause in Section 129 of the Code left untouched the original side rules of High Court whenever framed and the said rules would prevail over the Code.\nMuch before the enactment of RTI Act, which came on the statute book in the year 2005, this Court repeatedly emphasised the people's right to information to be a facet of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.\nThis was a comprehensive report which provided more than adequate justification for the decision of the ITSC to conclude that there had not been a full and true disclosure by the Petitioners of all relevant facts.\n\n\n vi) In Swami Shraddananda v. State of Karnataka5, the Apex Court held that no convict can claim remission as a matter of right.\nThe order of dismissal was assailed before the Supreme Court in a judgment rendered in the case of Meera Sahni (supra). \n\n50.\nNo explanation is forthcoming from these respondents why this time limit was not adhered to while registering the Wakf created MSR,J & TVK,J ::60:: wp_20707_2018&batch under the Wakfnama 01.01.1955 by Smt.

Barnet London Borough Council, ex p Johnson [(1989) 88 LGR 73] the condition imposed by a local authority prohibiting participation by those affiliated with political parties at events to be held in the authority's parks was struck down.\" \n\n \"83.\nAfter careful consideration of the case on the whole, the Ministry has come to the conclusion that Media One TV channel had violated Rule 6(1)(c) & (e) of the Programme Code prescribed under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and the rules framed thereunder by telecasting said news regarding the North East Delhi violence.\"\nBy a letter dated February 5, 2013, petitioner put on record such facts.\nThe amount of Rs.1,03,000/\u00ad, which was received by Janakiammal from the Insurance Corporation after the death of her husband was given to defendant No.1, which was utilised for business purposes.\nThe Supreme Court later in Indira Gandhi Vs Raj Narain , has struck down cl.(4) of Article 329 on the ground that it violates the Rule of Law and free elections which according to the Court constitutes the basic feature of the Constitution.\nThat decision was assailed by the State Government by way of LPA No. 233/2006 before the Division Bench of the High Court, which came to be allowed vide impugned judgment and order dated 26.4.2011.\nThe answer to the said question lies in the Constitution Bench Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Muthuramalingam and Ors vs. State represented by Inspector Of Police 54 wherein it is held that it is perfectly legal for a person to be sentenced to more than one life term.\nAfter hearing the parties, all the writ petitions were dismissed, by a common order, dated 12.04.2018.\nHe admits that panchas and witness Sharad Kacharu Pawar are co- villagers.\nSo his evidence is inconsistent with prosecution case because it has come out in evidence that Gopalakrishnan was taken first to the District hospital.\nANNEXURE - I: COPY OF THE G.O.(RT) NO.3273/2016/HOME DATED 1.11.2016.\nIn the case of Mohd. Hashim v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others8, the question examined was in relation to minimum sentence provided for an offence under Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 19619, providing for minimum sentence of six months.\nPW-23 Varun Gumber also supported the case of prosecution though not entirely but he has deposed that dead body was found in front of his dhaba.\nThough Learned senior counsel Sri Mukul Rohatgi relied on the judgment of this Court dated 21 st August,2019 in Criminal Appeal No.1165 of 2019, but we are of the view that the said judgment would not render any assistance to support his case.\n(Writ Tax Petition No.524/2021), dated 30.09.2021, reported in 2021(10) TMI 517, the learned Single Judge had quashed the notices issued under Section 148 of the Act.\nFurther, the bridge was inaugurated by the Minister concerned, on 15.08.2016, and the bridge is being used by the commuters and, therefore, a request was made for grant of permission for shifting of the 5th respondent A4 shop to the afore-stated building bearing D.No.4/498-14 & 4/498-15 as the said building was not affected in the acquisition proceedings.\n(Exh.84)\n (x) Reply of the Public Information Officer - cum -  Deputy Collector, Dholka dated 19.01.2018 to the petitioner.\nBasing on the above said complaint, the police of Mydukur U/G PS registered a case in Cr.No.428 of 2015 under Sections 323, 354, 506, 509 r/w 34 IPC.\n\n\n It was not just the speech of any member in Parliament.\nTherefore, under the facts and circumstance of the case and the reasons stated above, I do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment and order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court and up held by the Hon'ble Apex Court.\nAs per the original return of income filed on 31.07.2016, only Sub-head C of Schedule FA has been filled up.\nThe constitutional court also step in to ensure that the policy makers have devised the effective use of its enabling powers which the Constitution has conferred on them.\nIn Ankush Maruti Shinde (supra), Hon'ble Apex Court has observed as under:-\n \"On the culmination of a criminal case in acquittal, the concerned investigating/ prosecuting official(s) responsible for such acquittal must necessarily be identified.\nOn the other hand, the representation that gives rise to the legitimate expectation may augment the applicant's procedural rights, as exemplified by the Liverpool Taxi case.\nFurther, there is an apparent contradiction in the three-Judge Bench decision in McDowell [State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co.,\n(1996) 3 SCC 709] when it is said that a constitutional challenge can succeed on the ground that a law is \"disproportionate, excessive or unreasonable\", yet such challenge would fail on the very ground of the law being \"unreasonable,     unnecessary      or   unwarranted\".      \nMr. Masood Shareef, learned Counsel for the petitioner in Writ Petition No.7717 of 2019, Mohd. Abdul Wahid Vs. Smt. Nilofer in respect of the first question, has invited our attention to paras 14 to 18 of the referral order, and submits that a party in all cases, has to be equated with a witness.\nBut this decision does not come in the way of the Court issuing the mandamus to consider whether the time for bringing Section 30 of the Advocates Act, 1961 into force had arrived or not.\nIn Mi Hla So v. Nga Than (1912) 13 Cri. L.J. 53 (Burma), the accused Nga Than was in love with Mi Hla So.\nCounsel submits that the version of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3 with respect to the incident is contradictory, inasmuch, as, PW-1 Dharmender Sharma deposed that on 19.12.1997, he along with his father Sh. Keshav Ram Sharma were present at their house at about 07:30 PM.\nHe speaks with regard to he joined the very same branch and got marked the documents Exs.P13 to P45 in order to substantiate the case of the prosecution; but he admits that he joined the Bank in September 1994 and also got marked the documents pertaining to Sri Venkataswamy and execution of Ex.P23.\nUnder Sub-clause (b) of Rule 27 (1) of Order XLI CPC when the appellate court finds that for passing of a judgment, just and R.F.A.No.447 of 2006 proper, the incorporation of the document proposed to be received and marked in additional evidence is very much relevant and inevitable, it is empowered to receive and mark it in evidence.\nP.W.8 Anandakumar S/o Kundappa who is other I.O. and then P.I. of Halsurgate PS has testified with regard to filing of charge sheet in view of completion of investigation.\nA similar view had earlier been taken in the case of State of Karnataka Vs. K.Gopalakrishna Shenoy and another3, wherein in the context of Mysore Motor Vehicles Taxation Act, 1957 it was held that the owner having a motor vehicle, in respect of which a certificate of registration is current, is bound to pay the tax even if the vehicle is incapable of being put in use.\nTrue it is, some investigation has been carried out by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police after the case being transferred from Noida as there was total inaction by the Noida police.\nThe objection was upheld by the Small Cause Court, the Judge being of opinion that though under Or.III, r. 1, a recognised agent can indeed appear, act and apply on behalf of the plaintiff or defendant by whom he has been authorised to do such things, \"the law does not give him the power to plead on behalf of his principal\".\nThe only issue which then falls for determination is whether the flat buyers in these circumstances are constrained by the stipulation contained in clause 14 of ABA providing compensation for delay at the rate of Rs 5 per square feet per month.\nBaliram Sharma (P.W.5) states in his evidence that 16 years ago at the time of occurrence, there was hulla in the village that MCC Party members had arrived.\nWe are not so much concerned with the other Chapters, namely, Chapters IV to IX of the 2010 Act, except Section 17 (in Chapter IV) which deals with foreign contribution through scheduled  (e) if the holder of the certificate has not been engaged in any reasonable activity in its chosen field for the benefit of the society for two consecutive years or has become defunct.\nThis apart, the Ex.P.39 certified copy of MR No.19/97-98 of Kembathahalli village, evidences that after the death of Chinnappa, the names of children of Chinnappa came to be mutated to the properties mentioned therein, including the acquired lands and it also evidences that wife of Chinnappa predeceased him.\nThis principle has been laid down in the cases of Plasmac Machine Manufacturing Co. Pvt. Ltd. vs. Collector of Central Excise, Bombay [1991 Supp.(1) SCC 57] and Dabur India Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Central Excise, Jamshedpur [(2005) 4 SCC 9].\nThe municipality issued the work order on 07.10.2008 and the same day an agreement was entered into between the municipality and the private respondent; the municipality released 12% of the total cost, i.e., \u20b9 1,44,00,000/- as mobilization advance to Respondent No. 9 on 20.12. 2008. \n\n7.\nThe material on record before the High Court in the form of inspection report dated 20.04.2019 and further materials including the Divisional Commissioner\u2019s affidavit, showed irregularities of a severe nature.\nDESCRIPTION OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY Residential building bearing No.14, 3rd Cross, Assessment No.48, Khatha No.1870, Priyadarshini Layout, Malagalu Village, Moodala Palya, Bangalore 560 072 total admeasuring 1200 Sq.ft together with all rights, appurtenances whatsoever whether underneath or above the surface of the property and bounded on the East by: Property of Meena Sudhakar West by: Private property + high tension line North by: 22'' road South by: Property of Munikrishna\nSince we have heard storming arguments on the point of the ceiling imposed by the Apex Court in matters of reservation, and the judgment in Archana Reddy by the Andhra Pradesh High Court is heavily relied upon, we should be conscious of even one percent of reservation being conferred by the State without quantifiable data.\nTherefore, contributions, if any, made by any lessee prior to the effective date determined by the Supreme Court cannot be refunded, instead, the same could be adjusted towards the subsequent payments.\nHe then informed to SDPO that he was holding the identification parade on 23rd March, 2012.\nThe 73rd Amendment came to the Constitution by way of amendment under Article 368 and, therefore, it cannot be said to be a basic feature of the Constitution.\nThe petitioner, Dr. Y.Adilakshmi, who is serving on the post of Civil Assistant Surgeon, Hyderabad, has filed the present writ petition challenging the order, dated 22.02.2017 allocating her to the State of Andhra Pradesh.\nThe appellants have relied upon site plan, Ex. D.16 prepared by R.S. Ghuraiya (P.W.20) in the presence of D.R. Sharma (P.W. 19).\nAgain, in Ramashish Rai v. Jagdish Singh, the following observations were made by this Court: (SCC p. 501, para 7) \"7. ...\nWe may have again to look into provisions of Sections 437 (5) and 439 (2) of Cr.P.C. Sub-section (5) of Sections 437 of Cr.P.C uses expression \u2018if it considers it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested and commit him to custody\u2019.\nWhile considering various decisions of the High Courts and approving the decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court rendered in State of Haryana vs. Kailashwati, AIR 1980 P&H 117, this Court held that the interest awardable under Section 28 would include within its ambit both the market value and the statutory solatium.\nOnly after concluding that none of the other castes / communities, demanding internal reservation within the 20 per cent reservation granted to MBCs and DNCs, satisfied the test of viability or feasibility for internal reservation, the Janarthanam Commission had recommended 10.5 per cent internal reservation for the Vanniakula Kshatriyas.\nAn opportunity of personal hearing was given as well to the petitioners, fixing 12:30 p.m. on July 3, 2019 for such hearing.\nIt is further the case of the prosecution that at about 1:50 p.m, the accused was apprehended along with bag by Ct. Mamta with the help of SI Surender.\nIt is in that context that the observations made by this Court in the case of Baladin2 assume significance; otherwise, in law, it would not be correct to say that before a person is held to be a member of Crl. Appeal Nos. 1709-1710 of 2019 (@ SLP [Crl.]Nos.2497-2498 of 2019) The State of Madhya Pradesh vs. Killu @ Kailash & Ors.\nPage No 9 of 61 India Insurance Co.

Devaky v. State of Kerala (1986 KHC 1), is a case charged under S.55(g), the question arose Crl.M.C.2719 of 2020 is whether accused was entitled to get a second analysis of the sample.\nThe evidence of Romesh Chand PW 6 that the family had an amount of Rs 40,000 lying at\nThe learned Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) erred in ignoring the fact that, the issue involved was disputed and in the light of ratios laid down by Karnataka High Court and also the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the provisions of section 143(1)(a)(ii) of the act could not have been invoked and no adjustment U/s.143(1) of the act could have been made.\nAgain an instructive insight can be obtained from the observations of Justice Holmes of the American Supreme Court in the case of State of Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. [51 L Ed 1038 : 206 US 230 (1906) : 27 SCR 618] , which was a case involving air pollution in Georgia caused by the discharge of noxious gases from the defendant's plant in Tennesee.\nHe has also placed on record the State/Union Territory wide percentage of population of OBC in India in the year 2011-12 in the form of the NSSO Report no. 563 (employment and unemployment) and according to him, the percentage of OBC patil-sachin.\nLand Acquisition Officer took possession of the lands, including Sy No. 61 of Kodigehalli from its owners on 27.03.1991.\nIn Nasiruddin & Ors. vs. Sita Ram Agarwal, reported in AIR 2003 SC 1543, the Court held that it is well settled that when negative words are used, the Court would presume that intention of the legislature was that the provisions are mandatory in character.\nThe Additional Commissioner, Nagpur    and Arbitrator under the National Highways    Act, 1956, having office at Old Secretariate    Building, Civil Lines, Nagpur - 440001.\n4.\nHe stated that accused is friends with Dinesh Gupta.\nOne Mohd. Aslam, who was also one of the petitioners in Constitution Bench Judgment in Ismail Faruqui\u2019s case filed a writ petition seeking certain reliefs with regard to 67.703 acres of land acquired under the Act, 1993.\nThis conflict or inconsistency now stands resolved by virtue of the amendments introduced under the Finance Act, 2010.\nCabinet Secretary took stock of the situation, preparedness, rescue and relief operations and directed that immediate and continued assistance be provided to Kerala to meet this crisis.\nAccording to the appellants, the flat buyers had already paid for the super area in terms of clause 1.6 of ABA including common areas and facilities which would be deemed to include car parking under the KAO Act.\nMohd. Masiuddin Farooqui (P.W.5), the defendant and he met only once, i.e., on 02.10.1994.\nBy reading these Provisions, Mr. Shalin Mehta, learned Senior Counsel would contend that the Board is a Body Corporate constituted under the Provisions of the Waqf Act.\nThis power of superintendence also extends to the administrative functioning of these courts and tribunals [Shalini Shyam Shetty & Anr. v. Rajendra Shankar Patil [(2010) 8 SCC 329]].\nIn response to this, it was submitted that there cannot be any quarrel with the said contention, but the aforesaid judgment of the M.P. High Court is not at all relevant to the facts of the present case.\n\n\n Both the courts have upheld the Will after recording a finding that execution of the Will has been proved on examining attesting witness Inder Singh as PW13, Sub-Registrar Baldev Singh, who registered the Will has been examined as PW5.\nFurther, learned counsel relied upon the Judgment of this High Court in the case of H. Narasimha Rao v.

State of Punjab [(1975) 4 SCC 497 : 1975 SCC (Cri) 571 : AIR 1975 SC 1727] has laid down that if the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is totally inconsistent with the medical evidence, this is a most fundamental defect in the prosecution case and Crl.A.

Aggarwal (the petitioner) as PW-1 and Anil Sharma as PW-2.\nHence, applying the test aforesaid, to the question of retrospective application of the amended provisions, involved in the instant batch of writ applications, would make it evident that the object in introduction of the amendments, through Benami Amendment Act of 2016, is to effectively cure the mischief which could not be checked effectively, as intended by the Principal Act of 1988.\nIt is submitted that the Hon\u2019ble High Court directed in its order dated 20.06.2019 in WP No.17384 of 2019 that the respondents are to submit a report in the form of an affidavit, duly supported by documents as to what action has been taken against the alleged violations.\nThe said judgment was reported in M.
